## Traveler

Traveler helps you organize a trip or vacation by places you will visit, all in a very stylish manner. Create a trip, and then start adding landmarks, restaurants, bars, and other places you would like to go to.

## Motivation

In creating this app, I wanted to help keep your travel itinerary all in one place. Partly inspired by the New York Times weekly travel guide 36 hours, I thought it would be helpful to create your own travel itinerary and make organizing your trip all the more easier.
